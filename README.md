# Loan_Default_Prediction_Assignment
The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a person is a high risk applicant based on the loan and personal information provided.

Our client is an finanical firm that has supplied Loans to its customers. They now need assistance in developing a model to predict if a person will default on the loan based on the loan and personal information provided.

Building a model to predict if a person is high risk applicant to issue the Loan is extremely beneficial to the company because they can then plan communication strategy to reach out to those customers and optimise its business model and revenue.

Now, we have information about demographics (gender, age, employment status Bank Balance), Loans (Months_loan_taken_for, Loan_history, umber_of_existing_loans_at_this_bank) and so on to predict whether the customer would be interested in Vehicle insurance.

0 = Low credit risk i.e high chance of paying back the loan amount

1 = High credit risk i.e low chance of paying back the loan amount

Key points:

There are more male applicants. Majority of high risk applicants are also male candidates.
We observed that applicants between the ages of 25 and 40 are more likely to be high risk, indicating that young individuals are smart enough to cheat. data.
Majority of High risk applicants are skilled workers with 1 - 4 years of experience.
Individuals with low balance are more likely to be high risk applicants.
Loans with less than two appear to be high risk applicants.
We can see that individuals who pay accurately are high risk applicants, implying that they will pay correctly for a few days and then cheat.
Applicants who are approved for 12 months, 24 months, or 36 months are considered high risk.
Applicants with a high EMI rate of percentage are more likely to be labelled high risk.
Banks have more high-risk applicants than stores.

Improvements:

By using a marketing and advertising approach, we can reduce the gender gap.

Before approving a loan, we must first check the credit score.

We can provide loan for an individual who has better salary record.

Ask them Include a co-applicant with a better credit score.

Ask them to present a guarantor for the loan.
